// Ransom note:

// Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's
// not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a
// Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to
// influence the midichlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark
// side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side
// of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He
// became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which
// eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
// everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He
// could save others from death, but not himself.
