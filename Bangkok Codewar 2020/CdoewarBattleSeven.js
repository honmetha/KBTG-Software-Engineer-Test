// This is a diagram of a metro system similar to the BTS, showing the station codes. The central station is code CEN and other stations have codes like E1 or N2.

// To visit the stations ["E1","E2","S2"] in order requires 5 stops (E1 to E2 is 1 stop, E2 to S2 is 4 stops)

// How many stops are required to visit these stations in order:
